      "description": "I’m Ricardo Soto-Fabela and I’m a software developer. I just recently finished serving 10 years in the united states navy with a background in firefighting. In that time, I learned and accomplished many thing in my career like being awarded the military firefighter of the year and having the pleasure of successfully training my whole department to be proficient in aircraft firefighting. However, I felt as if there was more for me to accomplish. One where I can challenge myself and have the ability to be financially free with a successful future. Thats when I discovered coding. I started learning to code on my own and I just enjoyed every minute of it. I could picture myself working for google or a start up company writing code to help better the lives of millions of people around the world. With my given experience of problem solving and leadership from my pervious career field. I feel as if I can help contribute right away in the tech industry.",
